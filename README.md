# Yatagan
Yatagan is a project to give attribution to Github contributers by when you used their projects. It allows for manual entry as well to create a page of attribution for your life. 

Yatagan was named by unscrabling the phrase "Thank you to all, and to all a good night." that was broken down into an acronym and compared to choices in Scrabble.

This project is intended to list attribution for one's entire life/career, listing usernames of people that helped you to learn programming or helped you to advance in life in any way.
